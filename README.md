They have six shops in Tokyo now, but it seems that only Kiyosumi Shirakawa shop has a roster. There might be a long queue on weekends, so be ready.

It's a small place with few seats, so not suitable for work. Once you get your coffee, buy some sandwiches at [the bakery in front of the cafe](https://tabelog.com/tokyo/A1317/A131706/13030788/), bring them to [Setagaya Park](https://goo.gl/maps/WyzwsFZZ3a72) and enjoy! Then for lunch or dinner, I recommend [Sun Kee](https://tabelog.com/tokyo/A1317/A131705/13007076/) for Hong Kong food or [Fungo](https://tabelog.com/tokyo/A1317/A131706/13008406/) for humbergers. Both are in this area.

This is getting super popular these days, so finding a seat is very difficult. But still this is my favorite place. They also opened [a very cool Norwegian furniture store](http://www.norwegianicons.no/showroom/) next door, you should definitely check it.

A bit far from the center of Tokyo. It's a small coffee shop, but very local and not so crowded. There's [my favorite pizza place](https://tabelog.com/tokyo/A1317/A131710/13165472/) close to the shop!

I like their espresso. It's a very small coffee stand, only five seats. The director of this shop is from [Onibus Coffee](http://www.onibuscoffee.com/), so you won't regret it.

## Mamehiko - Udagawa, Shibuya :star::star::star: :computer:

A bit expensive, but good quality for coffee and food. Its relaxed atmosphere is good for remote work. They have power and WiFi. There's another Mamehiko store in [Shibuya Koen-Dori](https://tabelog.com/tokyo/A1303/A130301/13155794/) which is also good for work.

They have some other stores in Tokyo, but the one in Shibuya is the flagship. Not many seats. [The one in Gohongi](https://tabelog.com/tokyo/A1317/A131702/13168558/) has more seats and good for work, and more importantly, there's my favorite Ramen place, [BIGI-YA](https://tabelog.com/tokyo/A1317/A131702/13093976/) just 8 minutes away.

## Little Nap COFFEE STAND - Yoyogi Hachiman :star::star::star::star:

Has only few seats. Get a coffee, then get a burger at [ARMS](https://tabelog.com/tokyo/A1318/A131810/13019608/), then enjoy them at [Yoyogi Park](http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3034_002.html)! All of them are in the same area. Or you can come here after having a delicious Vietnamese lunch at [Yoyonamu](https://tabelog.com/tokyo/A1318/A131810/13204833/).

My favorite Japanese cycle shop, [Blue Lug](http://bluelug.com/) started a coffee stand. Their espresso has a unique flavor, best for a latte.

:warning: All you can do in this shop is to taste a cup of coffee. Reading a book, working on your laptop, chatting with your friend and taking photos are prohibited by the house rule. The time you're allowed to spend here is less than 30 minutes. Wow, yeah? Better to go with someone who's fluent in Japanese. Then try "Miyabi Set", a combination of three cups of coffee, only costs 2500 JPY. Read [this article](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/globalhead/20150410/p1) before you go (Sorry in Japanese!)
